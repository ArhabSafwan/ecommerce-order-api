1. Project Overview and Features

This submission delivers the core foundation for the E-Commerce platform, prioritizing security and data management over the transactional workflow (Orders).

Completed Core Features:

Authentication (JWT): Full token-based authentication using Laravel Sanctum/Passport (or equivalent JWT package) for secure API access.

Authorization (RBAC): Strict Role-Based Access Control enforced across all management endpoints for Admin, Vendor, and Customer roles.

Vendor Security Scoping: Implemented logic to ensure Vendors can only manage (view, update, delete) the products they own. Admins have unrestricted access.

Product Management (CRUD): Complete functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting Products and their associated Variants.

High-Performance Search: Product search functionality is implemented using MySQL Full-Text Search (FTS) in Boolean Mode for fast, relevant results.

Architectural Focus:
The codebase adheres strictly to the Repository Pattern and utilizes Service Classes to separate business logic from the controller layer, ensuring maintainability and testability.

2. Local Setup Instructions (Step-by-Step)

Follow these steps to get the application running locally:

Clone the Repository:

git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
cd [repo-name]


Install PHP Dependencies:

composer install


Setup Environment File:

cp .env.example .env


Generate Application Key:

php artisan key:generate


Configure Database and FTS:

Ensure your .env file points to a MySQL database.

Crucially: Ensure your database service (e.g., Docker, XAMPP) is running.

Run Migrations and Seed Database:
The migration file for the products table includes the necessary FULLTEXT INDEX required for the search feature.

php artisan migrate --seed


Note: Seeding creates the roles (Admin, Vendor, Customer) and the initial testing users.

Generate JWT Secret Key (If using tymon/jwt-auth):

php artisan jwt:secret
php artisan config:clear


Start the Local Server:

php artisan serve

4. API Authentication Guide

This API is protected using JWT Bearer Tokens. All requests to protected routes must include a token in the Authorization header.

Quick Start: Getting a Token

Login Endpoint: Use the following credentials (from the seeder) to acquire a token:

Endpoint: POST /api/v1/auth/login

Test Admin Credentials: email: asafwan72@gmail.com | password: 12345678

Using the Token: Set the following header for all protected requests:

Header Key: Authorization

Header Value: Bearer [token_from_login_response]

Detailed Documentation

For a full breakdown of all roles, access levels, specific vendor scoping rules, and all testing credentials, please refer to the dedicated file: API_Authentication_Guide.md

5. Testing Instructions

To run the available tests (Unit Tests for the Service and Repository layers):

php artisan test


Note: Due to time constraints, the Feature/Integration tests for all API endpoints are incomplete/missing, but the core functionality has been verified using the exported Postman Collection.
